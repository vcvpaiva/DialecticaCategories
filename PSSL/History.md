This is a directory to keep a copy of the several pages of listings of programmes of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic. The original compilation was done by Julia Goedecke for the 100th edition of the PSSL.
More information will be added later on.

Gavin Wraith, one of the founders of the PSSL, has this list on his website
